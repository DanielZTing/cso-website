### Commit Messages
To keep things organized, use semantic commit messages. Semantic versioning is not currently enabled.

#### Examples:
```
chore: add Oyster build script
docs: explain hat wobble
feat: add beta sequence
fix: remove broken confirmation message
refactor: share logic between 4d3d3d3 and flarhgunnstow
style: convert tabs to spaces
test: ensure Tayne retains clothing
```

### Branching

NEVER commit straight to master. Create a branch name prefixed with `<lastname>-`. When you are ready to merge, merge origin/master into your branch (if there have been changes since you made your branch) then open a pull request for a code review.
